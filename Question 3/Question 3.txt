**Question 3**

You are given a JSON file named "employees.json" that contains employee data in the following format:

[
   {
       "id": 1,
       "name": "John Doe",
       "department": "Marketing",
       "salary": 50000,
       "join_date": "2022-01-01"
   },
   {
       "id": 2,
       "name": "Jane Smith",
       "department": "Sales",
       "salary": 60000,
       "join_date": "2021-05-15"
   },
   {
       "id": 3,
       "name": "Mark Johnson",
       "department": "Finance",
       "salary": 75000,
       "join_date": "2023-02-28"
   }
]

Your task is to write a Python script that performs an ETL process on the given JSON file to transform and load the data into a Microsoft SQL (or any SQL) database. Here are the details:

1. Create a table named "employees" in the Microsoft SQL (or any SQL) database with the following
columns: id (integer), name (text), department (text), salary (integer), and join_date (date).
2. Extract the data from the JSON file.
3. Transform the data by converting the "join_date" string to a date format and removing any unnecessary
fields.
4. Load the transformed data into the "employees" table in the Microsoft SQL (or any SQL) database.
5. Handle any necessary error handling and data validation during the ETL process.
